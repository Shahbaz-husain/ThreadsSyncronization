Project Goal :
In this project, we will learn how to call one thread from another thread in sequence without creating any deadlock situation.

Project Problem :
User will give input that how many threads should created and how many characters should be printed using each thread, and what is the string from which characters should be printed.


For Eg : 
string = shahbaz
t_count = 2
c_count = 2

OUTPUT :
t1 = sh
t2 = ah
t1 = ba
t2 = zs
.

.
and so on

This project is all about thread synchronisation and how it works.
